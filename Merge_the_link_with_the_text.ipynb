Alternating every other year, these exceptional\\nresearchers are rewarded for their important contributions to the progress of\\nscience, either in Life sciences or in the fields of Physical sciences,\\nMathematics and Computer science.

The For Girls in Science program offers selected\\nhigh school girls the opportunity to join a support program throughout the\\nschool year, which includes participation in a scientific challenge, a\\nscientific trip and inspiring meetings, cultural outings and visits to\\ncompanies. Individual academic... Discover the program and participate\\nL\\'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Women scientists are leading ground-\\nbreaking research across the world. But despite their remarkable discoveries,\\nwomen still represent just 33,3 %* of researchers globally, and their work\\nrarely gains the recognition it deserves. Less than 4 % of Nobel Prizes for\\nscience have ever been awarded to women, and only 11 %* of senior research\\nroles are held by women in Europe.As the world hurtles towards a future\\nthreatened by climate change and resource scarcity, the global scientific\\ncommunity must lose no time in recognising and promoting women scientists’\\nachievements.The Fondation L’Oréal and UNESCO have worked together for more\\nthan 20 years to help empower more women scientists to achieve scientific\\nexcellence and participate equally in solving the great challenges facing\\nhumanity.To date, we have awarded more than 100 laureates, five of whom have\\ngone on to win Nobel Prizes. Working in the Physical sciences, Formal sciences\\nand Life sciences on five different continents, these eminent women\\nresearchers are helping to change the world through their discoveries, and are\\nalso role models for younger generations of women researchers who want to\\npursue their scientific careers and break the glass ceiling.Each year, the\\nL\\'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science programmes also support more than 250\\ntalented young women researchers. Through its 52 regional and national\\nprogrammes, the Fondation L\\'Oréal and UNESCO support them at a crucial period\\nin their careers, during their thesis or post-doctoral studies.However, we\\nmust remember that there is still much more to be done to achieve true gender\\nequality in science. But we remain determined, and we are moving steadily\\ntowards making our vision a reality. One day, we will live in a world where\\ngirls are encouraged to study science, where women have adequate support to\\nbalance the responsibilities of research and motherhood, and where scientists\\nare judged purely on the merit of their discoveries and the potential of their\\nwork to change the world. *UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2021) Key\\nfigures 3900 More than 3900 Alumnae around the world 500 scientific experts\\ninvolved in the selections worldwide 110 More than 110 countries covered by\\nour programs 52 national and regional programs worldwide L\\'Oréal-UNESCO For\\nWomen In Science _ \"Gender diversity leads to new and better quality science.\"\\nJEAN-PAUL AGON CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF L\\'ORÉAL, CHAIRMAN OF\\nTHE FONDATION L\\'ORÉAL \"By advancing the cause of women, we can drive progress\\nin science.\" AUDREY AZOULAY GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED NATIONS\\nEDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION \"The work of our Young\\nTalents reflects the importance and vitality of scientific research.\"\\nALEXANDRA PALT EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FONDATION L’ORÉAL FAQ CGU\\nPolitique de confidentialité Cookies © 2022 Fondation l\\'Oreal.
